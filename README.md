# AlphaCare Insurance Analytics

## Overview
Welcome to the AlphaCare Insurance Analytics repository! This project focuses on analyzing historical insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies and identify low-risk targets for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions. The goal is to leverage data analytics and machine learning to enhance the company's offerings and attract new clients.

## Project Objectives
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and uncover insights.
- Implement statistical modeling to predict total claims and optimal premium values.
- Utilize A/B hypothesis testing to evaluate risk differences across various demographics.
- Set up Data Version Control (DVC) for efficient data management and versioning.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and model training.
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started
# Project Requirements

## General Requirements
- **Programming Language**: Python (version 3.x)
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy for numerical operations
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning and statistical modeling
  - DVC (Data Version Control) for managing data and model versions
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management and collaboration

## Task-Specific Requirements

### Task 1: Git and GitHub
- Create a Git repository for the project.
- Develop a comprehensive README file.
- Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions.
- Commit code regularly with descriptive messages.

### Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)
- Install DVC using pip: `pip install dvc`.
- Initialize DVC in the project directory: `dvc init`.
- Set up local remote storage for DVC.
- Track datasets using DVC: `dvc add <data.csv>`.
- Commit DVC files to the Git repository.
- Push data to local remote storage using `dvc push`.

### Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing
- Define clear hypotheses for A/B testing.
- Select appropriate metrics for evaluation.
- Segment data for analysis.
- Conduct statistical testing to analyze outcomes.
- Document findings and interpret results.

### Task 4: Statistical Modeling
- Data Preparation: Handle missing data, perform feature engineering, and split data.
- Modeling Techniques: Implement various modeling techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate models using relevant metrics.
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Git
- DVC (Data Version Control)

### Installation
